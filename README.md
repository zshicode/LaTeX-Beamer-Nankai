October 17, 2019 （南开大学百年校庆纪念版）对幻灯片排版和背景图做了进一步美化

December 17, 2019 增加：南开大学课程报告模板，可用于课程大作业的报告撰写等

December 12, 2020 增加：
- 可将beamer的幻灯片显示比例由4:3调整至16:9（默认为4:3）
- 添加`slides-authoryear.tex`，可将参考文献格式由数字格式改为作者-年份格式。

两个模板对在LaTeX中常用的格式，包括itemize, enumerate, description, 图片，表格，代码，伪代码等等，都给出了示例。

## LaTeX beamer style for Nankai University

[LaTeX beamer style for Nankai University](./beamer_nankai)
1. This is an unofficial LaTeX beamer style for Nankai University, the style file is `nkcolor.sty` and the example file is `slides.tex`.
2. These files are initially based on [Edward Hartley's work](http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/EdwardHartley), and [@teancake](https://github.com/teancake) from BUAA(Beihang University, 北京航空航天大学) gave a [Beihang version Beamer style](https://github.com/teancake/latex-beamer-beihang) from that work.

To compile the slides, use:
```
xelatex slides
biber slides
xelatex slides
xelatex slides
```
and you can get the PDF.
<br/>

The default aspect ratio of beamer page is 4:3, while you can change it into 16:9 by using
```
\documentclass[hyperref,UTF8,11pt,aspectratio=169]{beamer}
```

For using the author-year citation format, you can compile `slides-authoryear.tex`.

## Report Template

[Report Template](./report_template)

To compile the report, use:
```
xelatex report
biber report
xelatex report
xelatex report
```
and you can get the PDF.

## Others

As you have noticed, other LaTeX styles or even Markdown styles are also included in the folder [single_file_model](./single_file_model), such as `typora_monokai.css`, `document_model.tex`, `warsaw_beamer_model.tex` and `recent.tex` (with `recent.bib`). They are single, simple and basic. The `deepblue.sty` is a LaTeX beamer style based on `nkcolor.sty`, but I don't use an image as background or logo in this style, and the theme color is deep blue.

[A LaTeX theme of Python](./python_theme_beamer) is also available. The `pycolor.sty`, and the example of using this style is given by `pyeg.tex`. This file use the `pythonhighlight.sty`, the package is loaded by the following line:

```tex
\usepackage{pythonhighlight}
```

It is then possible to include a Python snippet directly in the code using:

```tex
\begin{python}
def f(x):
    return x
\end{python}
```

It is also possible to include inline Python code in LaTeX with ``\pyth``:

```tex
The special method \pyth{__init__}... 
```

Last but not least, you can load an external Python file with:

```tex
\inputpython{python_file.py}{23}{50}
```

to display the contents of the file ``python_file`` from line 23 to line 50.

What's more, the `mcode.sty` gives a implementation to highlight MATLAB .m-code in LaTeX.
